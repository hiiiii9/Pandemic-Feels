      <p>Know that sharing your struggles with a loved one can help relieve the burden off of you. Although you may not trust that they will be willing to help you, you will not know unless you try. Alternatively, utilize social media to help find people with similar interests. Groups on Facebook and Reddit are a great way to meet people around you or with similar hobbies such as yours.

<p>Exercise has shown to release endorphins, which are the hormones that are linked to happiness. Exercise regularly to help clear your mind and promote the best physical and mental health for yourself. Try grabbing a yoga mat, going for a jog, or even shooting some hoops. Getting some sunshine alone has shown to release endorphins, as well as serotonin, just remember to follow your local guidelines before doing so.</p>

<p>Sleep is one of the most critical factors in maintaining good mental health. Scientists say that we need a minimum of 7 hours of sleep every night. Although the amount of sleep we get is important, the time we go to bed is even more significant. Try sleeping in the ideal interval between 8pm and midnight. It is better that you sleep closer to 8pm however, because of the fact that adrenaline is released around 11pm in the average human being, making sleep difficult and sometimes erratic.</p>
