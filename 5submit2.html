      <p>Firstly, if you are still in a state of anger, throw some water on your face and get away from the place where you first felt these feelings. Go for a walk or quick jog and think about what is triggering your anger. Identifying your triggers will help you tackle these situations.</p>
<br>
<p>Once you have identified your triggers, write them down or make a mental note on how you will deal with it the next time around. Are you unjustifiable shifting blame or are you going to strive to deal with your anger? You must look at yourself honestly. Self reflection is critical in creating change. If not then think about the harm that has, or may potentially come, from acting in a state of rage. The people you could harm, especially yourself.

<p>Also, have a healthy outlet to release pent up frustrations. Exercises such as boxing, weight lifting, or even hiking, can help blow off some steam in tense situations. Creative outlets such as keeping a diary, writing a blog, or painting your moods, are also excellent hobbies to add to your daily routine. Know that consistency is key and that small actions over a long period of time are better than bold actions for short term gain.</p>
